				By accessing and using JustForMyFriends's services through your Merchant Account (as defined below), you agree to the following terms and conditions and any policies, guidelines or amendments thereto that may be presented to you from time to time (collectively, the "Terms"). If the law or our functionality changes and affects the services we are able to offer you through your Merchant Account, we may need to change these Terms or our program features from time to time. You should review these Terms regularly. If at any time you do not agree with these Terms, or you do not agree to any modified Terms, then you must immediately stop using your Merchant Account and cease your participation in any JustForMyFriends programs. Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with JustForMyFriends, these Terms govern your use of our services through your Merchant Account. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the terms of a deal ("Offer") created or submitted via a Deal Request through your Merchant Account (a “Deal Request” or “DR”), these Terms shall govern. You and JustForMyFriends may be referred to throughout these Terms individually as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties”.
			</p>
			<h5> Section 1: DEFINITIONS </h5>
			<p>

			</p>
			<h5> Section 2: JUSTFORMYFRIENDS MERCHANT ACCOUNT </h5>
			<p>
				2.1 Merchant Account. In order to use certain services, you are required to be registered for a special account on the JustForMyFriends Site (your “Merchant Account”).   Your Merchant Account will facilitate your use of various JustForMyFriends services and will allow you to provide and receive current and accurate, contact and other information pertaining to your relationship with us. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Merchant Account password, and are responsible for all activities that occur under such account. You agree to immediately notify JustForMyFriends of any unauthorized use of your password or Merchant Account or any other breach of security related to the JustForMyFriends Site. JustForMyFriends is not and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 2.1. In addition to the other rights set forth herein, JustForMyFriends reserves the right to refuse service and/or access to the JustForMyFriends Site to you or any other merchant at any time without notice for any reason. When using your Merchant Account and the JustForMyFriends Site to submit and manage other deals, you will be required to accept and comply with certain terms and conditions applicable to merchants. JustForMyFriends may offer certain optional features or functionalities within your Merchant Account. If you choose to use such features, then you may be required to agree to separate terms that are specific to those features that will be disclosed and available at the time you elect any such option. You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and have full power, capacity and authority to accept these Terms. If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms. If you don't have the legal authority to bind your entity, please ensure that only an authorized person from your organization consents to, and accepts, these Terms.
			</p>
			<p>
				2.2 Merchant Center. The Merchant Center is the section of your Merchant Account (in contrast to any individual user account you may maintain) where you as a business owner may directly, or indirectly through an authorized employee or representative, access your business profile and information about past offers that have run through the Program and manage your offers by tracking voucher redemption.
			</p><h5> Section 3: PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AND YOUR OFFER </h5>
			<p>
				3.1 Creation of Offers. By electing to participate in a Program, you shall define the conditions of, and supply the content and images to describe and illustrate, your Offer and its terms, by completing and submitting a DR through your Merchant Account. Your submission of a DR does not obligate JustForMyFriends to accept to the DR or to promote the Offer, and is not binding on JustForMyFriends until JustForMyFriends actually promotes the Offer on the JustForMyFriends Site.  At the point JustForMyFriends begins to promote your Offer to the public, the Sales Period begins and the Offer becomes an "Active Offer" during such Sales Period. You are responsible and liable for all Offer content and terms, and for JustForMyFriends's or any purchaser's use or reliance on any of the foregoing. In creating your Offer, you may not: (a) offer to sell any goods or services on terms or in a manner that is prohibited by law from being offered or advertised; (b) include any content that violates or infringes in any way upon the rights of others; or (c) include any material that is unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, vulgar, obscene, profane or otherwise objectionable, which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any Law.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.2 Promotion of Offers. If JustForMyFriends accepts your DR, JustForMyFriends will promote the Offer using any method and through any medium that JustForMyFriends deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including through e-mail, mobile applications and any other type of electronic interface or distribution channel owned, controlled or operated by JustForMyFriends. JustForMyFriends further reserves the right, but has no obligation, to promote the Offer through its affiliates and third party business partners from time to time. JustForMyFriends may promote your Offer to JustForMyFriends customers and potential customers based on geographic or other geolocational data, but will determine the customers and potential customers to whom your Offer is actually promoted and made available in its sole discretion. If you indicate a maximum number of vouchers in the DR, JustForMyFriends will stop promoting your Offer once such maximum is reached.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.3 Distribution of Vouchers. Once JustForMyFriends has received payment from a purchaser of the amount paid, JustForMyFriends will authorize for use, and make a voucher available to, the purchaser of your Offer (or will distribute it to a designated transferee on behalf of the purchaser, if any is designated at the time of purchase). The vouchers will include any restrictions or limitations on the use of the voucher you have specified in the DR. Purchasers, or their authorized transferees, may then redeem the Offer by presenting their Vouchers to you as printed certificates, through their mobile devices, or any other media that JustForMyFriends has adopted for voucher redemption.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.4 Responsibility for Offer and Vouchers. You acknowledge that you are the exclusive seller of your Offer and the issuer of the vouchers. You also are responsible and liable for: (a) the decision to make your Offer available through the JustForMyFriends services; (b) fulfilling your Offer with respect to all voucher holders; and (c) supplying all goods and/or services specified in the Offer.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.5 Redemption Obligations. You shall comply with your obligations specified in these Terms, the DR and other obligations regarding the use of your Merchant Account. In addition, when redeeming vouchers, you shall: (a) honor the vouchers during the time period specified on, pursuant to the terms of, your Offer, and as required under applicable law(s); (b) handle all customer service in connection with the redemption and use of the vouchers; (c) honor any voucher presented by an individual, even if that individual was not the purchaser, unless (i) otherwise specified in the Offer Details (as defined below) or otherwise stated  prominently on the face of the voucher or, (ii) you reasonably believe that individual obtained the voucher in an unauthorized or illegal manner, in which case you shall immediately contact JustForMyFriends and explain the circumstances; and (d) comply with the terms and conditions stated on the voucher without modification and without imposing any restrictions or additional charges or penalties that are not expressly stated on the voucher. You shall specify all generally applicable policies (e.g., cancellation policies that apply to all customers), restrictions and contractual arrangements (e.g., liability waivers required for all customers) applicable to the Offer ("Offer Details") in the DR, and JustForMyFriends shall have no liability for your failure to do so.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.6 Expiration Periods. You shall allow voucher holders to redeem any valid vouchers for the Full Offer Value until the voucher’s stated Promotional Value Expiration unless the Laws require a longer period.  For any voucher presented after such voucher’s applicable Promotional Value Expiration, you must not continue to honor the vouchers.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.7 Redemption Reporting and Recognition Periods. You shall accurately report redemption data for all redeemed vouchers to JustForMyFriends within seven (7) days after the vouchers’ Promotional Value Expiration Date (the “Redemption Reporting Period”). All vouchers issued but not reported by you during the Redemption Reporting Period (“Unredeemed Stores vouchers”) will be deactivated. Once the Redemption Reporting Period has passed, you may not alter your report.  Any vouchers redeemed by you after the Redemption Reporting Period are Unauthorized Redemptions. Unauthorized Redemptions are your sole responsibility. You may not report redemption data for Unauthorized Redemptions, and JustForMyFriends will not pay you for Unauthorized Redemptions.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.8 Your Third Party Merchants. You may subcontract or delegate portions of your performances required by these Terms with respect to a particular Offer to a third party (each, a “Third Party Merchant”). If you subcontract or delegate to Third Party Merchants with respect to fulfilling such Offer, you will remain solely responsible and liable for (a) all your obligations, including financial obligations, under these Terms and (b) all acts and omissions of your Third Party Merchants. You shall require your Third Party Merchants to comply with all applicable restrictions and obligations imposed on you under these Terms, and you will be solely responsible for your financial and contractual relationship with your Third Party Merchants.
			</p>

JustForMyFriends will pay you the Remittance Amount every two weeks if the total Remittance Amount (“Aggregate Net Amount”) due is more than Zero Dollars ($0). Following the Promotional Value Expiration, JustForMyFriends will continue to pay you for any vouchers redeemed every two weeks where the Zero Dollar threshold is met, or as otherwise agreed between you and JustForMyFriends in writing.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We also automatically track
certain information about you based upon your behavior on our Site. We use this
information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and

information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on
our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or
not), your computer browser information, your IP address and your location,
etcetera.</span></p>

disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.</span></p>

style='color:black'> All of your activities in the public areas of the Site will
be identifiable to your User ID, and other people can see your published

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='color:black'>Subsidiaries and Affiliates;
Service Providers</span></i><span style='color:black'>.&nbsp; We may from time
to time use the services of affiliates, subsidiaries and unrelated service
providers in the operation of the Site, and may disclose personal information
to them in the course of our use of their services.&nbsp; For example, we may
use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the operation of the
Site.&nbsp; This may involve the hosting of data, including personal
information, on servers operated by those hosting companies.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='color:black'>Legal Requests; Emergencies;
Jurisdictions</span></i><span style='color:black'>. We cooperate with law
enforcement inquiries and demands for information that are made under force of
law. We are also cognizant of the need to address emergencies. Therefore, we
may disclose your personal information (a) to any governmental authority as
part of an investigation to determine our compliance with any applicable law,
rule, or regulation (including privacy laws, rules, and regulations), (b) in
response to a court order, subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful
judicial or administrative proceeding, (c) as otherwise required under any
applicable law, rule, or regulation, and (d) in good faith, to protect or
defend our rights or property or those of other users. Finally, please note
that in some cases, personal information that we collect may be stored or
processed outside of Canada.&nbsp; In such cases, we continue to protect the
information with appropriate safeguards, but it may be subject to the legal
jurisdiction of those countries and governmental authorities in those
countries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We may also disclose personal
information to the acquirer or its agents in the course of the sale of our
business.&nbsp; If we do this, the disclosure will be subject to
confidentiality arrangements customary in such transactions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Our Retention of Your
Information</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We retain personal information for
only as long as required to fulfill the identified purposes for which it was
collected or as required by law. When you register on the Site, archived
personal information that you have provided will not ordinarily be erased
unless and until your entire account on the Site is deleted, and even then we
may retain some or all of your personal information on back-up files; provided,
however, we assume no obligation or guarantee to archive any information and do
not warrant that any archived information will later be made available to you.</span></p>

Activity</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Site is a public forum. You
should be aware that information which you voluntarily include and transmit
online in a publicly accessible forum such as the Site may be viewed and used
by others without any restrictions.&nbsp; We are unable to control such uses of

create a profile (“Profile”) and privacy settings. You may modify or remove any
of the information in your Profile at any time by logging into your account and
making the desired changes. For technical reasons, any modifications or
deletions which you request may take a short period of time to take effect. If
you change or delete any of your personal information, we will remove the old
or deleted information from public view; however, we may keep such information
archived beyond this point in time, as noted under “Our Retention of Your
Information” above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Kickbak strives to protect your
personal information. For security of transactions, we use the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any personal information you enter into
registration forms on the Site. The encryption process protects your
information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. We
also make commercially reasonable effort to ensure the security of your
personal information on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over
the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any
information you transmit to us.</span></p>

included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and
disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose
your information to other parties through the Site, different rules may apply
to their use, collection and disclosure of the personal information you
disclose to them. Since we do not control the information use, collection or
disclosure policies of third parties, you are subject to their privacy
policies. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal
information to others.</span></p>
